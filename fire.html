            <p>Firebending, one of the four elemental bending arts, is the pyrokinetic ability to control and produce fire. It is unique among the bending arts, as it is the only one in which the performer can generate the element.</p>
            <p>The first human firebenders lived in a city atop a lion turtle during the era of Raava and the art later spread to the Sun Warriors, the Fire Nation, and the United Republic of Nations. The Earth Kingdom also has a small firebending minority.</p>
            <p>As described by Iroh, fire is the element of power, consisting of overpowering force tempered by the unflinching will to accomplish tasks and desires. However, during the Hundred Year War, a militaristic Fire Nation twisted this into firebending being fueled by rage, hatred, and anger.</p>
            <p>Firebending draws its power from the sun, and the first human firebenders derived their firebending techniques from the dragons.</p>
            <p>Firebending is known for its intense and aggressive attacking style and general lack of adequate defensive moves, although firebenders can modify offensive maneuvers to function as a defense, such as creating large walls of fire or shooting down incoming attacks with fire jabs.</p>
